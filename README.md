This is a simple stock screener to filter out stocks in following requirements:
1) is uptrend in last 3 months
2) latest price above ma_150 and ma_200
3) yearly and quarterly gross profit growth exceed 20% in last two to three years or quarters
4) yearly revenue growth exceeds 20%
5) quarterly eps growth exceeds 20%

Unlike standard screener in the market, program only counts the TRUE value, but not screen stock fulfilled all requirements.
